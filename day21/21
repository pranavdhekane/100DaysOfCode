Day 21: 

2. Abstraction in Java
Abstraction is the process in which we show only esential functionality/details to the user the non-essential is are not displayed.

In java, Abstraction is achieved by using abstract classes(0% to 100%) and interfaces(100% abstraction);

Abstract classes and Methods : 
abstract classes are declared with abstract keyword
abstract methods are the methods that are declared without implementation
A class having one or more abstract methods have to be declared with abstract keyword
A abstract class may have some concreate methods also
There can be no oject of abstract class

Algorithm to implement Abstraction in java: 
Define Abstract class/interfaces
Define Abstract methods that do not have any implementation
implement concreate classes that extends abstract classes/ implement interfaces.
Override the abstract methods in concreate classes with specifuc implementation
use concreate classes to implement the logic of the program(cause abstract classes cannot be used)

//example
abstract class shape{
    private String color;
    //abstract methods
    public abstract void printInfo();
    public abstract double area();

    //construtor
    shape(String color){
        this.color = color;
        System.out.println("shape constructor is called");
    }

    //concreate method
    String getColor(){
        return color;
    }
}

class sqaure extends shape {
    double length;

    //constructor
    sqaure(String color, double length) {
        super(color);
        this.length = length;
        System.out.println("Sqaure constructor is called");
    }

    //overidden method
    @Override
    public void printInfo() {
        System.out.println("Color of shape is " + super.getColor()  + "\nArea of shape is "+ area());
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return length * length;
    }
    
}
public class day21 {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        sqaure s1 = new sqaure("black", 2);
        s1.printInfo();
    }
}

//Interface , is the another way of achieving abstraction. By using interfaces we can achieve 100% abstraction. 

3. Encapsulation in Java 
Encapsulation is a way of hiding implementation details of a class from outside access.
IN java, it is achieved by declaring instance variables private so they can be used only within the class. and To allow outside access to the variables public methods called getters and setters are defined.
Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. Another way to think about encapsulation is, that it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield. 

//example
class Encapsulate {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    //setters
    public void setName(String name){
        this.name = name;
    }
    public void setAge(int age){
        this.age = age;
    }

    //getters
    public void getInfo(){
        System.out.println(name +" : " + age);
    }
}
public class day21{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Encapsulate e1 = new Encapsulate();
        e1.setName("pranav");
        e1.setAge(18);
        e1.getInfo();
    }
}

4. Polymorphism in java
Poly = many , morph = forms. The word Polymorphism means having many forms.
Polymorphism allows us to perform single action in different ways.

types : 
Compile-time Polymorphism
Run-time Polymorphism

i. Compile-time Polymorphism
this kind of Polymorphism is also know as static Polymorphism. This is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading 
//java doesn't support operator overloading 
When multiple functions with same name but different parameters are are defined then these function aer said to be overloaded.
the functions can be overloaded by differing the no of arguments or type of arguments.

//example
class Polymorphism{
    public static int add(int a, int b){
        return a + b;
    }
    public static int add(int a , int b, int c){
        return a + b + c;
    }
    public static double add(double a, double b){
        return a +b;
    }
}
public class day21{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Polymorphism.add(1, 2));
        System.out.println(Polymorphism.add(1, 2, 3));
        System.out.println(Polymorphism.add(1.1, 2.0));
    }
}

ii. Run-time Polymorphism
This type of Polymorphism is achieved by method overiding. Method overiding happens when a derived class has a defination of member function of a base class.
the base funtion is said to be overidden.

class one {
    void print(){
        System.out.println("class one");
    }
}
class two extends one {
    void print(){
        System.out.println("class two");
    }
}
class three extends one {
    void print(){
        System.out.println("class three");
    }
}
public class day21{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        two b = new two();
        three c= new three();

        b.print();
        c.print();
    }
}
