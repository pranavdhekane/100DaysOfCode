//String buffer 
it is mutable 
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Pranav");

    Methods	    Action Performed
    append()	Used to add text at the end of the existing text.
    length()	The length of a StringBuffer can be found by the length( ) method
    capacity()	the total allocated capacity can be found by the capacity( ) method
    charAt()	This method returns the char value in this sequence at the specified index.
    delete()	Deletes a sequence of characters from the invoking object
    deleteCharAt()	Deletes the character at the index specified by the loc
    ensureCapacity()	Ensures capacity is at least equal to the given minimum.
    insert()	Inserts text at the specified index position
    length()	Returns the length of the string  


//string builder 
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Pranav");
String Builder is not thread-safe and high in performance compared to String buffer.
also it is mutable.


//When what should be used
If a string is going to remain constant throughout the program, then use the String class object because a String object is immutable.
If a string can change (for example: lots of logic and operations in the construction of the string) and will only be accessed from a single thread, using a StringBuilder is good enough.
If a string can change and will be accessed from multiple threads, use a StringBuffer because StringBuffer is synchronous, so you have thread-safety.
If you donâ€™t want thread-safety than you can also go with StringBuilder class as it is not synchronized.

//Conversion
1. String to StringBuilder and StringBuffer

String str = "pranav";
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(str);
StringBuilder sbl = new StringBuilder(str);

2. StringBuffer & StringBuilder to string // using toString()

StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("pranav");
StringBuilder sbl = new StringBuilder("pranav");
String str = sb.toString();
String str1 = sbl.toString();

3. StringBuffer to StringBuilder and vice versa
//first converting them to String and then into each other using constructors

StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Geeks");
String str = sb.toString();
StringBuilder sbl = new StringBuilder(str);
