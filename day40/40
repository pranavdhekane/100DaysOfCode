// Count Digits
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 30.45%Submissions: 191K+Points: 2
Given a number N. Count the number of digits in N which evenly divide N.

Note :- Evenly divides means whether N is divisible by a digit i.e. leaves a remainder 0 when divided.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 12
Output:
2
Explanation:
1, 2 both divide 12 evenly
Example 2:

Input:
N = 23
Output
0
Explanation:
2 and 3, none of them
divide 23 evenly

Your Task:
You dont need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function evenlyDivides() which takes an integer N as input parameters and returns an integer, total number factor of digits N which divides N evenly.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

class Solution{
    static int evenlyDivides(int N){
        // code here
        int i = 0;
        int num = N;
        while(num >= 1){
            int last = num % 10;
            if(last != 0)
            if(N%last == 0){
                i++;
            }
            num/=10;
        }
        return i;
    }
}
