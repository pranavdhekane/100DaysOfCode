🚀 Supercharged and ready to level up my coding game! 🌟 Embarking on an electrifying #100DaysOfCode journey starting TOMORROW! Join me as I conquer the thrilling world of Data Structures and Algorithms! 💻✨

🔍 Starting from scratch with Java while bringing my C basics to the table. 📚 Dive into the captivating realm of DSA with me as we unlock the secrets of efficient problem-solving and optimize our code!

💡 Why DSA? It's the powerhouse behind cutting-edge software development, enabling us to craft ingenious solutions to complex challenges! 🚀

👶 New to this, but ready to conquer and learn along the way! 💪 Despite knowing that I might stumble, sometimes feel demotivated, or even be wrong, I'm committed to pushing forward and learning from every experience.

📆 My Flexible Action Plan:

Week 1-2: Dive into the basics of arrays and linked lists!
Week 3-4: Conquer trees and graphs like a coding ninja!
Week 5-6: Dive deep into essential algorithms - searching and sorting, here we come!
Week 7-8: Crack the code with dynamic programming and greedy algorithms!
Week 9-10: Unleash advanced strategies and problem-solving techniques!

📂 Stay tuned for epic code implementations and progress updates in my Git repository https://github.com/pranavdhekane/100DaysOfCode ! Let's make waves in the coding community together! 🌊💥

📚 Fueling my journey with knowledge from GeeksforGeeks, epic YouTube tutorials, and who knows, maybe even kickstarting a blog along the way! 🚀📚

🎉 Are you ready to join the adventure? Let's ignite our passion for coding, learn, grow, and inspire! 💪💻 #DSA #Java #CodingJourney #LearningAndDevelopment #Programming
